# Ciflord2
`Ciflord2` is a **console application** that can manipulate CIFs (Crystallographic Information Files) and generate (nice) tables from the CIF. The application philosophy is automation. User input should be as low as possible. Ciflord2 is compatible with CIFs generated by `SHELXL` program starting from `SHELXL-97`, though support for `SHELXL-97` is limited. The application is written in `PureBasic`. Read the [help file](help.md) for more information how to use the program.

The program uses the "Value Interface" from Nicolas Goeddel for some calculations. See http://www.forums.purebasic.com/german/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=15675 for more information.

## Compilation

  * Copy all files from the `ciflord2` folder and open `ciflord2.pb` with `PureBasic`. 
  * In the `Compiler Options` from the `Compiler` menu select `Console` as `Executable Format`.
  * Select `Create Executable...` from the `Compiler` menu. 
  
Testet with Windows 10 (x64) and Linux (x64) and PureBasic 5.50.
